    image: "/images/guitarb&w.jpg"
    content: "Inspired by his grandfather’s playing, Burl picked up a guitar at the age of five and immediately took to it. After being denied both a seat in the elementary school band (the guitar is a stringed, not brass, instrument), and the elementary school symphony (but isn’t the symphony for stringed instruments?) he locked himself in his room and learned to play by ear listening to old cowboy records. 

    Somehow he stumbled upon Eric Clapton’s unplugged album in junior high and was enamored by Clapton’s fingerstyle guitar (later he realized most of the tunes on the album were covers of American Blues guitarists). He spent months trying to figure out every song on that album.  
    
    Soon after that came Doc Watson, which led to Mississippi John Hurt, which led the path to a lifelong passion of studying American Roots Music.
    
    College had him traveling from West Virginia to ETSU in Johnson City, TN. Deep in Appalachia on the edge of the Blue Ridge mountains, Burl was exposed to lots of Bluegrass and Old Time music. He was gifted a banjo and soon began exploring bluegrass flat-pick guitar and three finger, scruggs style banjo.
    
    After college he moved to Salt Lake City, Utah to play in the snow and work in the ski industry. On the side, he could be found playing in numerous roots and Americana bands. He has since picked up other instruments including Stand-up Bass, clawhammer banjo, ukelele, and most recently old-time fiddle.
    
    After 35 years of playing guitar, Burl has discovered the joy of teaching others to play. Come join in as we unlock the secrets to fingerstyle style guitar, while exploring the amazing repertoire of American Roots Music"
